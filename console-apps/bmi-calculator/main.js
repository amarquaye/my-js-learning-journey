// Simple program to calculate the body mass index of an individual.
// A BMI of 25.0 or more is overweight, while the healthy range is 18.5 to 24.9.
// BMI applies to most adults 18-65 years, but it is not used for muscle builders, long distance athletes, pregnant women, the elderly, or young children.
// BMI does not take into account whether the weight is carried as muscle or fat, just the number.
// Healthcare providers use BMI and other tools and tests to assess someone's health status and risks.
